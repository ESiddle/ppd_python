    "One of the strengths of Python is its community and the numerous packages at your disposal. As a result, there is a wide range of figure making libraries out there. The overview below is from Jake VanderPlas' talk [\"The Python Visualization Landscape\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FytuB8nFHPQ) at PyCon 2017:\n",
