Demo Spyder in the first session
Go slower
Explicitly send an email notification, don't rely on balckboard update
Add Ben Macleod and other technicians
Book the Constable Terrace space

From the suggestions:

Keep doing:
Stay friendly
I like the workbook format
practical exercises 
use actual data for exercises, which makes the content easier to follow than some random made up data
carry on as you are because you're great
Liked how many of the examples related to my work, and even offered explanations on things beyond the scope of python figures.
Great examples to work through.
Wandering round and offering tailored assistance and enthusiasm
mix of exercises and theory, suggest applications of functions
Exercises; Notebook (great to be able to look through in own time); course was really well delivered
Lots of exercises.  Sending installation instructions in advance.
Everything is great, I wish this introductory course would be actually split down into two as it would make it easier for beginners to digest the content better. 
 Spyder

Stop doing:
Relying on UEA IT to set things up correctly
Setting anaconda up is the hardest part maybe do this in class
explaining new concepts really quickly (or assuming that everyone knows mathematical concepts like matrices)
It was mentioned that some content was removed? Maybe this could be left in for those who wish to skip ahead to something more technical.
It went a little bit too fast for an absolute beginner.
Assume people have a bit less knowledge than you did .
speaking so damn fast

New things:
have a few more pointers on how to write the code for the more complex exercises. At the moment, the options are to try yourself or look at the answers
add discussion of extra tools (git, pyucharm etc.)
